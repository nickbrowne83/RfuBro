<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The mission is to build upon the current awareness level of the Barrier Reef Orchestra in order to increase the current attendance rate for each show in order to generate the company a higher degree of profit.</p>
<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<p>brief details of who did what</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Matthew: </strong> Was responsible for the generation of the HTML, CSS and JS. He also generated the design of the final template along with the assistance of Earl.</li>
    <li><strong>Earl: </strong> Was responsible for the reformatting and allocation of data. He generated an easy to follow word document with all of the information ready to import into the website while also helping drastically with the editing of images in photoshop so that they could fit nicely within the photo gallery.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>From what can be seen with our tests, the site works just fine however there are sometimes slight issues with the buffering of the background image. It must be stated that even though the JS form validation seemed to have worked, the data doesn't correctly transcribe across to the google spreadsheet. On top of this it will be found that iFrame was used instead of JS for the implementation of Facebook integration, this is because we spent literally hours attempting to get various plugins to work including the test that we conducted during a prac a few weeks ago. We deemed that the plugins aren't compatible anymore as they must have updated over the past week or so as that's when the issue arised even though we didn't touch that segment of code. Plus, iFrame provides a very easy and adaptable format for editors in case they wish to change the window height, width, etc.</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Considering that in the end we turned from a group of four into a dynamic duo, Both Earl and I agree that we lucked out in having each other as we both had strengths where the other had weaknesses. In saying that it was also really beneficial for us being in all the same classes apart web design as it enabled us to easily establish meetings regarding the assignment and in turn we worked more effectively than perhaps other groups did. We had a very clean flow to our work as we could easily just Facebook message or call one another and say 'hey can you get that segment organisedd for me tonight' and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> It's safe to say that we were both at a big disadvantage considering our other half of the team dropped out without giving us warning (we still haven't heard from them actually). From this we both had to pick up the slack and inevitably end up doing twice as much work as other full man teams had to. However we made it to the end and we're proud of that in our own right.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> This task was very interesting in the sense that it gave both of us insight into what university life is like from an early point on. We found that it just isn't possible to be slack as the chances are that everyone else will be doing just the same thing. We also discovered some rather intereesting properties regarding the scaling of iFrame and JS code on mobile platforms that will most definitely become useful in the future. </p>
