	<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
	<h2>Cairns - Group 10</h2>
		<p><strong>Members:</strong>Matthew Hall, Earl Dimitui, Nicholas Browne, ... </p>
	
    <h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>The mission is to build upon the current awareness level of the Barrier Reef Orchestra in order to increase the current attendance rate for each show in order to generate the company a higher degree of profit.
</p>
        
	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>The success of the mission can be evaluated upon in two ways. Firstly, by conducting a comparison between the amount of money earned before and after the new website has been published. A specific time period of three months will be allocated to this comparison in order to give the new version of the website an appropriate time frame to take effect. We estimate at least a 15% increase in the amount of tickets sold and donations to the company will be as a result of the new website.<br><br>

Secondly, a hit counter will be implemented into the website in order to track the amount of visits the website receives on average per day/week/month. Though this won’t directly affect the amount of revenue produced for the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with this along with the amount of people following the Facebook page the client will be able to effectively estimate the size of the community backing the company (the level of community awareness). Upon measuring this community base at monthly intervals from the website's inception, we estimate a growth in this community of at least 20% within 3 - 6 months.
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Judy Hunter, Vice-President of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, stated that the youngest member of the orchestra was in year 8 (13 years old) and the that the oldest member was 73. She did advise in the client interview that the site should suit an age group that spans across this range however as a team we’ve decided that this age bracket is simply too large to cater for. In response to the strong ties between the origin of the orchestra and JCU plus the need for social media integration it has been collectively decided that the website will revolve around an audience of people roughly around 17-25 years old (this is the average age range for most university students from younger generations).<br><br>

In order to cater for this age bracket it has been established that the website should follow these few basic elements:<br>
<ul>
        <li>Information must be refined and assigned appropriately throughout the website in order to cease the user from being deterred due to being overloaded with information (people don’t like reading a lot on websites).</li>
		<li>Images must be used appropriately and in conjunction with text in order to enhance the meaning of the information on the page (i.e. when displaying past conductors use an edited image of the person next to their description).</li>
		<li>The website’s design template must be contemporary and appealing to the eye.</li>
		<li>Calls to action should be used throughout the site in order to entice users into attending one of the orchestra’s shows.</li>
		<li>Becoming a member (sign-up page) and contacts should be easy to find as this is a crucial part towards the goal of the site. Plus, very few people will be determined enough to effectively search for information such as this unless it is presented to them.</li>
		<li>Social media should be integrated throughout the webpage (have a link such as “like us on Facebook!”).</li>
		<li>Even though the main audience is for younger people the website’s interface must be easy enough to use for people of all ages.</li>
</ul></p>
