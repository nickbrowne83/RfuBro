<h2>The Barrier Reef Orchestra</h2>
<h3>A North Queensland Icon</h3>
  <p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra was <strong>formed in Townsville in 2000</strong> after a workshop conducted by <strong>Richard McIntyre from Canberra.</strong> Over the past 15 years it has gone from strength to strength and now <strong>presents three main concerts a year</strong>, as well as smaller concerts such as the children’s concert Peter and the Wolf in 2014. We are a community orchestra, drawing players from a large cross section of the Townsville community and sometimes beyond. All are drawn together by their <strong>great love of orchestral music and desire to provide North Queensland with quality performances.</strong> Depending on the program up to 50 musicians play a wide ranging repertoire which has included some of the great orchestral compositions such as the <strong>New World Symphony by Dvorak</strong> and most of the <strong>Beethoven</strong> symphonies as well as <strong>Tchaikovsky and Bizet.</strong> <br><br>
    
<strong>In 2015 the orchestra was invited to perform in three festivals</strong>, joining with the <strong>AFCM</strong> to present a <strong>free public concert</strong> in Queens Garden the 1812; Dancenorth at Jezzine Barracks for Twilight and featured in World Music as part of the Townsville Civic Theatre music season. <strong>This was a first for the orchestra</strong> - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland. <br><br>

<strong>Now to 2016</strong> which is going to be a stellar year for your Orchestra. Already we have our <strong>three major concerts</strong> which will include <strong>opera, featuring Paul Tabone</strong> born in Ingham, but now working the international stage as a tenor based in Italy. <strong>Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.2</strong> featuring last year’s winner of the instrumental section of the ACVC, <strong>Arthur Athan.</strong> Our opening performance titled Dreams and Dances is sure to have some favourites such as Afternoon of a Fawn by Debussy.<br><br> 

We are also pleased to be part of the <strong>Townsville 150 Concert</strong> where we will share the stage with the likes of David Campbell, Luke Kennedy, Bronwyn Douglas and the 1 RAR Band just to name a few of the guests. We will be back to <strong>Queens Gardens</strong> for a repeat performance as part of AFCM due to the huge popularity of last year’s concert.
