	<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
	<h2>Cairns - Group 10</h2>
		<p><strong>Members:</strong>Matthew Hall, Earl Dimitui, Nicholas Browne & Daniyal Saeed</p>
	
    <h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>The mission is to build upon the current awareness level of the Barrier Reef Orchestra in order to increase the current attendance rate for each show in order to generate the company a higher degree of profit.
</p>
        
	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>The success of the mission can be evaluated upon in two ways. Firstly, by conducting a comparison between the profit earned before and after the new website has been published. A specific time period of three months will be allocated to this comparison in order to give the new version of the website an appropriate time frame to take effect. We estimate at least a 15% increase in the amount of tickets sold and donations to the company will be as a result of the new website.<br><br>

Secondly, a hit counter will be implemented into the website in order to track the amount of visits the website receives on average per day/week/month. Though this won’t directly affect the amount of revenue produced for the Barrier Reef Orchestra, along with the amount of people following the Facebook page and a sign-up page added to the site, the client will be able to effectively estimate the size of the community backing the company (the level of community awareness). Measuring this community base at monthly intervals from from the website's inception, we estimate a growth in this community of at least 20% within 3 - 6 months.
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>In response to the strong ties between the origin of the orchestra and JCU plus the need for social media integration it has been collectively decided that the website will revolve around an audience of people roughly around 17-25 years old (as this is the average age range for most university students).<br><br>

In order to cater for this age bracket it has been established that the website should follow these few basic elements:<br>
<ul>
        <li>Heightened focus on social media connectivity</li>
		<li>An added sign-up page </li>
		<li>Ease of navigation, clean and clear design to accommodate the wider range of possible audiences that may be less tech savvy</li>
		<li>The website’s design template must be contemporary and appealing to the eye with a colour code of Black, Blue, and Green, matching the formal black and blue and green accessories of the orchestra's attire.</li>
		<li>Calls to action should focus on several needs: events, orchestra’s shows; signing up; Facebook; and other promotions.</li>
</ul></p>
